    <h2>The end of the beginning</h2>
    <p>I'm man enough to simply say, 'I'm going to poop', and I'd be honored to have Ron Howard involved. I'd like to order one large phone with extra phones please. cell phone, no no no rotary... and payphone on half. I do not have discolored butthole flaps. Morty, I'm a drunk, not a hack.</p>
    
    <p>I don't like it here Morty. I can't abide bureaucracy. I don't like being told where to go and what to do. I consider it a violation. Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt? What about the reality where Hitler cured cancer, Morty? The answer is: Don't think about it. Awww, it's you guys! Wait, the whole time? I was screaming for help, and you stayed on the roof?</p>
    
    <p>Your special time is your power. It makes you strong like a boob. Grassss... Taste bad! I'll be with Reuben in my workshop while you guys are having another day in Phil Collin's proverbial paradise. That's because losers look stuff up while the rest of us are carp'en all them 'diems.</p>
    
    <p>Don't even trip about your pants, dawg. We got an extra pair right here. Save it for the Semantics Dome, E.B. White. Rick, I don't like glowing rocks in the kitchen trash! Why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry? Oh yeah you can't. They blew up.</p>
